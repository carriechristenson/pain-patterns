# README

This project is to create a comprehensive tracking platform for patients to track and manage their pain to find the patterns. Many apps track individual routines, such as sleep, exercise and diet, however it is the combination of these things and many others that can give a patient clarity about their pain, regardless of disease.

Backend in Rails, front-end in Angular 2.0, and potential ios app in swift to come!

Versions:

* Ruby version 2.3.3

* Rails 5.0.1
